# Computer Science 20

## CSE2010 Computer Science 2

Students explore hardware, software and processes at an intermediate level. Students extend their understanding of software development by learning how to layer modular programming approaches over structured programming techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithms and programs. They also are introduced to derived data types to provide them with data structures suitable for more demanding problems. Students add to their understanding of the hardware side of computer science by exploring a stylized von Neumann computer system at the machine level, and of the social side of computer science by examining some of the issues that have arisen from the implementation of computer technology.

## CSE2110 Procedural Programming 1

Students develop their understanding of the procedural programming paradigm. They move from a structured programming approach in which modules were handled through the use of program blocks to a more formal modular programming approach in which they are handled through subprograms. In the process, students also learn to use a number of new design approaches made possible by the new paradigms. As part of this process, they also learn what types of problems are amenable to modular algorithms and programs.

## CSE2120 Data Structures 1

Students learn how to design code and debug programs that use a set of data structures that can be used to handle lists of related data. Building on their knowledge of basic or primitive data types, they learn how to work with fundamental data structures such as the array and the record. As part of this process, they learn what types of problems benefit from the use of these types of data structures.

## CSE1220 Client-side Scripting 2

Students deepen their understanding of Internet computing by using more advanced markup language techniques and by being introduced to one or more Web-specific scripting languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses these resources as a means of displaying dynamic client-side information. Students learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and scripts that use structured programming approaches. 

## CSE2240 Robotics Programming 2

Students add to their understanding of robotics programming by employing procedural programming techniques and fundamental data structures to create programs that display greater agency and autonomy. They learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug robotics algorithms and programs in which modularity is achieved through subprograms such as functions and fundamental data structures such as arrays.
