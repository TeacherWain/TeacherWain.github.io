# Computer Science 10

## CSE1010 Computer Science 1

Students explore hardware, software and processes. This includes an introduction to the algorithm as a problem-solving tool, to programming languages in general and to the role of programming as a tool for implementing algorithms.

Some of these assignments and lessons content have been adapted from MIT OpenCourseWare, where there are a ton of free resources that you can choose from for your class. The programming language students learn in grade 10 is Python, which is an excellent entry-level language for students to learn. It leads into Java, C++, and others.

## CSE1110 Structured Programming 1

Students explore hardware, software and processes. This includes an introduction to the algorithm as a problem-solving tool, to programming languages in general and to the role of programming as a tool for implementing algorithms.

## CSE1120 Structured Programming 2

Students work with structured programming constructs by adding the selection and iteration program control flow mechanisms to their programming repertoire. They write structured algorithms and programs that use blocks to introduce an element of modularity into their programming practice. 

## CSE1240 Robotics Programming 1

Students use an appropriate Robot Control Language (RCL) to design, develop, implement and debug robotics programs that employ standard structured programming constructs and simple data structures. In the process, they develop a general understanding of robots and the robotics environment.

## CSE1910 Project A

Students develop project design and management skills to extend and enhance competencies and skills in other CTS courses through contexts that are personally relevant.

## CSE1210 Client-side Scripting 1

Students are introduced to Internet computing through the use of one or more Web-specific markup languages. As part of this process, students learn how the Web uses markup languages to provide a client-side approach to display static information. Students also learn how to analyze, modify, write and debug algorithms and documents that use a markup language.
