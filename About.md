# About Me

I am the Computer Science and Design Studies teacher at Leduc Composite High School. I am a passionate STEM education advocate in my community, and my focus is in increasing student efficacy and engagement in the classroom environment. Computer Science is a discipline centred around problem-solving and collaboration, and learning it is beneficial towards increasing student achievement in every area of education. I am active on Twitter, and my handle is @TeacherWain. 

This is not meant to be an all encompassing selection of computer science resources, just examples of what I have used in my classroom. If you feel it helps, please use it. This is more or less an online portfolio.
