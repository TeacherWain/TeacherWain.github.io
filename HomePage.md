# COMPUTER SCIENCE IS FOR EVERYONE

## MISSION STATEMENT

Computer Sciences are one of the most in-demand STEM fields in our society today. It is estimated that within the next 10 years we will have a 1.2 million shortage of computer engineers and scientists in the global economy. Because of this, the wages of a computing science graduate are roughly 40% higher than other STEM-related fields of work. The intentions of the program here at Leduc Composite High School are that we produce students who are capable of success in whatever field of study they choose, but specifically that they are set up to comfortably step into a first year computer engineering or computing science degrees.

## Course Descriptions

###Computer Science 10

Computer Science 10 students learn about computation and explore hardware, software and processes of computers. This includes an introduction to the algorithm as a problem-solving tool, to programming languages such as Python and the role of programming as a tool for implementing algorithms. Students will also be introduced to robotics and use an appropriate Robot Control Language (RCL) to design, develop, implement and debug robotics programs that employ standard structured programming constructs and simple data structures. In the process, they develop a general understanding of robots and the robotics environment.

###Computer Science 20

Computer Science 20 students extend their understanding of software development by learning how to layer modular programming approaches over structured programming techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithms and programs.They also are introduced to derived data types to provide them with data structures suitable for more demanding problems. Students will also extend their knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will continue to add to their understanding of robotics programming by employing procedural programming techniques and fundamental data structures to create programs that display greater agency and autonomy.

###Computer Science 30
Computer Science 30 students explore hardware, software and associated processes at an advanced level. They extend their understanding of software development by moving from procedural programming approaches to an object -oriented approach. In the process they learn how object-oriented programming (OOP) can improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithm development and program construction. Students will continue their work in robotics programming by adding object-oriented programming (OOP) approaches to their skill set. In the process, they learn how to adapt their older procedure-based approaches to an object-oriented approach. They learn how to use object-oriented design approaches to design and write programs that use objects associated with one another in a client/server relationship. It is important to note that Computer Science 30 is an equivalent course that can be used for university entrance requirements.
